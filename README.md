# Celebrity_Classifier

## Information

This image classification project involves predicting the celebrity based on an image of them using only AI. I did this by describing distinct features of that person such as eyes, 
nose, ears, etc and utilized that to state which celebrity that person is. To do this I downloaded images of different celebrities and I classified them by their face and their two eyes. 
If they did not have these features then I would print out an error that the person cannot be classified. For the people that can be classified them I grouped them all into a 
seperate folder where I can test how accurate my prediction are. I used SVM algorithm because I found it to have the greatest accuracy score and created a Python Flask Server for users to test.
