# Celebrity_Classifier

## Information

This classification project involves predicting the celebrity based on an image of them. For this example, I used Elon Musk and Bob Ross. 
I did this by describing distinct features of that person such as eyes, nose, ears, etc, and utilized that to state which celebrity that person is. I downloaded images of different celebrities and classified them by their face and two eyes. If they did not have these features then I would print out an error that the person cannot be classified. For the people that can be classified, I grouped them all into a separate folder to test how accurate my predictions are. I used the SVM algorithm because I found it to have the greatest accuracy score and created a Python Flask Server for users to test. I created a website where the user can upload an image and it will print out a probability score table.
